# balloon game

I made this game using Javascript, CSS, HTML and JQuery.

The aim of the game is to click the balloon and get points within the time limit, to pass each stage.

The theme of the game is the Syrian crisis, I was inspired by a Banksy video clip and have linked SaveTheChildren to my homepage so that you can make donations to the crisis in Syria.

I have added functions for each stage of the game and added functions to animate the balloon movement randomly. There is also a Score to record successful clicks and a Time limit and Target score to make it more challenging. For the black balloons I have added a function to end the game.
